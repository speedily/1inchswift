#### General 1inch Requirements for All Fusion+ Challenges

**Core Requirements:**
- Preserve hashlock and timelock functionality for the non-EVM implementation
- Swap functionality should be bidirectional (swaps should be possible to and from Ethereum)
- Onchain (mainnet or testnet) execution of token transfers should be presented during the final demo

**Stretch Goals (not hard requirements):**
- UI
- Enable partial fills
- Relayer and resolver

#### Technical Implementation with 1inch Cross-Chain SDK

**Setup Example:**
```typescript
import { SDK, PrivateKeyProviderConnector, NetworkEnum } from '@1inch/cross-chain-sdk'
import Web3 from 'web3'

const privateKey = '0x...'
const rpc = 'https://ethereum-rpc.publicnode.com'
const authKey = 'your-auth-key'
const source = 'hackathon-project'

const web3 = new Web3(rpc)
const walletAddress = web3.eth.accounts.privateKeyToAccount(privateKey).address

const sdk = new SDK({
    url: 'https://api.1inch.dev/fusion-plus',
    authKey,
    blockchainProvider: new PrivateKeyProviderConnector(privateKey, web3)
})
```

**Key SDK Features for Hackathon Projects:**

- **1inch API Key**: Request from [1inch Developer Portal](https://portal.1inch.dev/)
- **Target Chain Knowledge**: Understanding of the specific chain you're extending to

#### Quick Start Steps
1. **Install Core SDKs**: 
   - `npm install @1inch/cross-chain-sdk`
   - `npm install @1inch/fusion-sdk`
   - `npm install @1inch/limit-order-sdk`
2. **Install Chain-Specific SDKs** (if needed):
   - `npm install @1inch/solana-fusion-sdk` (for Solana projects)
3. **Get API Access**: Register for 1inch developer access
4. **Choose Target Chain**: Select from the priority or standard Fusion+ chains
5. **Study Chain Architecture**: Understand the target chain's consensus and token model
6. **Implement Core Logic**: Start with basic quote and order functionality
7. **Add Security Layer**: Implement HashLock and secret management
8. **Test & Iterate**: Deploy on testnets and refine your implementation

#### SDK Installation Commands
